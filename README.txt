//What is it?
This is an iPhone application used for calculating the Sunrise and Sunset times 
for given cities in the US.

//How do I use it?
First you need to set your location:
1) Open the application
2) Click the gears near the top right of the screen to view the "Settings" Screen.
3) Click the "Manually Choose Location" button. (Note that in the next release you will be able to use GPS to automatically detect your location).
4) Select your state (united states only) from the list
5) Select your city from the list
Your location will be saved so that even when you close the application, your settings and locale will be saved and restored.

You can optionally choose different sunrise and sunset types to be shown. To do so,

2) Use the switches to mark which sunrise/sunset types you'd like to be enabled, or disabled. Click the little "i" for more information about each type.
